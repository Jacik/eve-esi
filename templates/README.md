# Why change the templates

The templates in this folder are changed to allow new (yet to the library unknown) fields from
ESI. This is required as CCP changes the enum values without updating the openAPI specs!

So in parallel to the enum value we also store the string given by ESI.

For this special handling, different from the original code generated by openAPI generator,
we changed the templates.

# How to upgrade

When there are changes in the templates you need to extract the new templates
from the generator jar. This can be done by calling the following command in
the root directory of the project:
```
bash ./templates.sh
```

This extracts them in a folder called _out_.

The _pojo.mustach_ and _modelInnerEnum.mustache_ files are not from the _out_ directory but 
from _out/libraries/okhttp-gson_!

Copy the files to this folder and apply the changes from the _pojo.patch_ and _modelInnerEnum.patch_ file.
